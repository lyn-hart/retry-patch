Patch Codex CLI's retry backoff interval -- Linux/macOS build (ELF / Mach-O).

Verified against codex 0.159.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-musl). This is the
Unix (ELF/Mach-O) build of the codex patcher; for the Windows PE build use
codex-windows.py. The two jittered backoffs it targets are:

  1. codex-client/src/retry.rs::backoff(base, attempt)  -- generic retry path
       `sleep(backoff(policy.base_delay, attempt+1))`.
  2. core/src/util.rs::backoff(attempt)                 -- stream-reconnect path
       Re-export of codex_async_utils::backoff since 0.156 ("Reconnecting N/M"
       delay when the server sends no explicit retry-after).

Both compute `Duration::from_millis((f64_delay * jitter) as u64)` with
`jitter = rand::rng().random_range(0.9..1.1)`, and in this build both are
INLINED into their async poll functions -- so, unlike the 0.142.x layout, there
is no standalone `backoff` entry to overwrite with a return-stub.

Instead this patcher rewrites each site *in place*. The value that flows into
the inlined `Duration::from_millis(...)` lives in a GP register right before the
tail:

    <mulsd  xmm, xmm>            ; delay_ms = f64_delay * jitter   (last reg-form mulsd)
    ... saturating f64->u64 ...  ; clamp to a u64 millisecond count
    mov     rax, <millis_reg>    ; from_millis reads the count from <millis_reg>
    shr     rax, 3
    movabs  rcx/rdx, 0x20c49ba5e353f7cf   ; /1000 magic  -> secs + nanos

We overwrite the span between the final `mulsd` and that `mov rax,<millis_reg>`
with `mov <millis_reg>, <ms>` (+ NOP padding), so the native from_millis
codegen that follows splits our constant into {secs, nanos} unchanged. The
result is a fixed retry interval independent of base delay, attempt, and jitter.

Location is anchored on the same x86-64 Rust codegen used by ELF and Mach-O:
  * the single 0.9 rodata constant from `0.9..1.1` (deduped across both sites);
  * the `addsd xmm,[rip->0.9]` that consumes it (this is what distinguishes the
    jitter sites from unrelated 0.9 uses -- a plain `movsd [0.9]` is ignored;
    the MSVC-only movsd variant lives in the Windows script);
  * the `mov rax,reg / shr rax,3 / movabs <from_millis magic>` tail.
RIP-relative operands resolve in file-offset space on the single-mapping ELF /
Mach-O images, so no VA translation is needed (that is the PE-only complication
handled by the Windows script).

Site 3 (stream_max_retries().min(100) hard cap) is unchanged from prior builds:
the inlined `unwrap_or(5).min(100)` codegen is byte-identical, so the same tail
signature locates every inlined copy and we rewrite the cap immediate to
STREAM_MAX_RETRIES so a large stream_max_retries in config.toml is honored.

Sites 1-2 alone do NOT give a fixed interval, because two other delay sources in
core/src/responses_retry.rs outrank or bypass `backoff()` entirely:

  4. CodexErr::retry_delay (protocol/src/error.rs). Callers do
         server_retry_delay.unwrap_or_else(|| backoff(retry_count))
     A server-supplied Retry-After wins and `backoff()` is never called, so the
     wait becomes whatever the endpoint asked for. `Option<Duration>` is niche-
     encoded (nanos == 1_000_000_000 means None), so the branch reads:
         cmp  <r32>, 0x3b9aca00   ; None?
         jne  <skip the backoff call>
         call <codex_async_utils::backoff>
     NOP-ing the `jne` makes the fixed backoff unconditional. The is_retryable
     match above that branch is not a wait, so it is left alone. Accepted only
     when the call provably lands inside a patched backoff, which is what stops
     a look-alike Option<Duration> unwrap from ever being rewritten. On 0.159.1
     that accepts 4 sites: two call util.rs::backoff (the functions that also
     hold the site-5 ladder) and two call retry.rs::backoff.

  5. The `unbounded_connection_retries` ladder (Stable, default ON): on a
     ConnectionFailed the delay is a separate field that starts at
     `Duration::from_secs(5)` and doubles up to `from_secs(60)`. Those are plain
     whole-second constants, not `from_millis(f64 * jitter)`, so the sites 1-2
     anchors cannot see them. Rewriting the *load* pins the delay no matter what
     the ladder stored -- killing the 5s start and the doubling in one edit:
         mov <secs64>, [<base>+0x10]   ->   mov <secs32>, <whole seconds>
         mov <nanos32>,[<base>+0x18]   ->   xor <nanos32>, <nanos32>
     Both forms are exactly 7 bytes, so the stores of that pair into the async
     state machine (which is what identifies the sequence) stay in place. Site 5
     can only express whole seconds; RETRY_MS is rounded up to >=1s for it.

DESIGN RULE -- this patcher only ever changes "how long to wait after a failure
has already been declared". It must never change what counts as a failure, nor
how long detection takes (stream_idle_timeout_ms and friends are config, not
patch targets). Any site added later has to satisfy that; see README.md.

This changes the retry *interval*, not the retry *count*; use config.toml's
stream_max_retries/request_max_retries for the count (site 3 just unclamps the
stream cap so values >100 take effect).

Site 4 makes codex ignore Retry-After, so a genuine quota wall is retried every
second instead of when the server said to come back. That is the point of the
patch, but do not point it at an endpoint that will penalize the hammering.

Usage:
  python3 codex-linux.py --dry-run   (inspect only)
  sudo python3 codex-linux.py        (apply the patch)
  python3 codex-linux.py --restore
  python3 codex-linux.py --self-test

The retry interval and stream cap are fixed (RETRY_MS / STREAM_MAX_RETRIES).
